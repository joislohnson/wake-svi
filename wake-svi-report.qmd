# Introduction

This document contains key insights, reproducible code, and explanations for the steps I took to import, clean, transform, and analyze the CDC/ATSDR SVI data provided for Wake County, NC.

# Load Libraries

Load necessary packages to use functions throughout the document.

```{r}
#| output: false
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling
library(janitor) # clean up
library(labelled) # variable labels; compatible with dplyr 
library(readxl) # reading in excel files

# Import Data

After importing the file, I filtered the data to Wake County, NC for the purposes of this analysis. Using the tigris package, I created a shapefile tibble with Wake County's census tracts. I also incorporated supplemental data by importing a file with the health service zones in Wake County, which allow me to further spatially aggregate the data.

```{r}
#| output: false
## SVI file
wake_tbl <- read.xlsx('Data/svi-data.xlsx') %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% # Convert to tibble
  clean_names() %>% # Clean variable names
  filter(county == "Wake County") # Filter to Wake County only

## Wake census tracts
wake_tracts <- tracts("NC", "Wake")

## Health service zones
wake_service_zones <- read.xlsx('Data/health_service_zones.xlsx') %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% # Convert to tibble
  clean_names() %>% # Clean variable names
  mutate(across(geoid:tract, ~as.character(.x))) # Convert variables to character
```

# Clean Data

Steps to clean the data included: (1) converting the indicators provided to numeric, (2) creating overall variables for Wake County's total population and housing units, (3) cleaning the location variable to only include the census tract, (4) creating a population density variable, (5) converting indicators that are counts to percents for more consistent comparison across tracts, (6) calculating a count of overcrowded housing units since it was the only indicator provided as a percent, and (7) multiplying percentages by 100 and round to 1 decimal for easier interpretation in figures to be developed.

```{r}
wake_tbl_clean <- wake_tbl %>%
  mutate(
    # Convert variables to numeric
    across(area_in_sq_mi:people_25_w_o_high_school_diploma, ~as.numeric(.x)),
    
    # Create variables for total county population and total housing units
    total_pop = sum(population),
    total_housing_units = sum(housing_units),
    
    # Clean location variable
    location = str_extract(location, "^[^;]+"),
    
    # Create variable for population density
    pop_density = population/area_in_sq_mi,
    
    # Update indicators to percents for comparison
    ## Denominator = Population
    perc_below_150_percent_poverty = ppl_below_150_percent_poverty/population,
    perc_bipoc_residents = bipoc_residents/population,
    perc_w_o_high_school_diploma = people_25_w_o_high_school_diploma/population,
    ## Denominator = Households
    perc_hh_no_vehicle = households_with_no_vehicle/households,
    
    # Calculate count of overcrowded housing units
    overcrowded_housing_units = percent_of_overcrowded_housing_units*housing_units,
    
    # Multiply percentages by 100 and round to 1 decimal
    across(starts_with("perc_"), ~round((.x*100), digits = 1))
  )
```

# Merge Clean Data and Shapefile

I merged the cleaned dataset and the wake_tracts shapefile, joining by the "GEOID" field in the shapefile and the "fips_code" field in the cleaned data. Then, I merged the resulting file with the wake_service_zones shapefile to incorporate service zone data.

```{r}
wake_sf <- left_join(
  wake_tracts, 
  wake_tbl_clean, 
  by = c("GEOID" = "fips_code")) %>%
  drop_na(starts_with("perc"))

wake_service_zones_sf <- left_join(
  wake_sf,
  wake_service_zones, 
  by = c("GEOID" = "geoid")) %>%
  drop_na(starts_with("perc")) %>%
  mutate(zone_name = ifelse(zone_name=="East Central", "East\nCentral", zone_name))
```

# Analyzing Social Vulnerability Among Tracts

I wanted to identify the "most" and "least" socially vulnerable communities to visualize geographic disparities in social vulnerability factors across Wake County, so **I calculated the 75th and 25th percentiles** for each of the following indicators: rates of no high school diploma (age 25+), individuals below 150% FPL, overcrowded housing, households without a vehicle, and BIPOC residents.

I defined the **most socially vulnerable areas** as tracts in the **top 25%** across all 5 of the indicators: rates of no high school diploma among individuals 25 and over (\>= *5.6%*), individuals below 150% FPL (\>= *18.6%*), overcrowded housing units (\>= *3%*), households without a vehicle (\>= *6%*), and BIPOC residents (\>= *52.6%*). Similarly, I defined the **least socially vulnerable areas** as tracts in the **bottom 25%** across all 5 indicators: rates of no high school diploma among individuals 25 and over (\<= *1.2*%), individuals below 150% FPL (\>= *6.5%*), overcrowded housing units (*0%*), households without a vehicle (\<= *0.9%*), and BIPOC residents (\<= *23.9%*).

columns_of_interest <- c(
  "perc_below_150_percent_poverty",
  "perc_hh_no_vehicle",
  "percent_of_overcrowded_housing_units",
  "perc_w_o_high_school_diploma",
  "perc_bipoc_residents"
)

# Most Socially Vulnerable Tracts
## Calculate the 75th percentile for each indicator
upper_percentiles <- wake_tbl_clean %>%
  summarise(across(all_of(columns_of_interest), ~ quantile(.x, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)))

## Identify tracts where all values are in the 75th percentile or greater
highest_quartile_tracts <- wake_tbl_clean %>%
  filter(
    perc_below_150_percent_poverty >= upper_percentiles$perc_below_150_percent_poverty &
    perc_hh_no_vehicle >= upper_percentiles$perc_hh_no_vehicle &
    percent_of_overcrowded_housing_units >= upper_percentiles$percent_of_overcrowded_housing_units &
    perc_w_o_high_school_diploma >= upper_percentiles$perc_w_o_high_school_diploma &
    perc_bipoc_residents >= upper_percentiles$perc_bipoc_residents
  )

## Merge the highest quartile tracts with the shapefile
highest_quartile_tracts_geo <- wake_tracts %>%
  inner_join(highest_quartile_tracts, by = c("GEOID" = "fips_code"))

# Least Socially Vulnerable Tracts
## Calculate the 25th percentile for each indicator
bottom_percentiles <- wake_tbl_clean %>%
  summarise(across(all_of(columns_of_interest), ~ quantile(.x, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)))

## Identify tracts where all values are in the 25th percentile or lower
lowest_quartile_tracts <- wake_tbl_clean %>%
  filter(
    perc_below_150_percent_poverty <= bottom_percentiles$perc_below_150_percent_poverty &
    perc_hh_no_vehicle <= bottom_percentiles$perc_hh_no_vehicle &
    percent_of_overcrowded_housing_units <= bottom_percentiles$percent_of_overcrowded_housing_units &
    perc_w_o_high_school_diploma <= bottom_percentiles$perc_w_o_high_school_diploma &
    perc_bipoc_residents <= bottom_percentiles$perc_bipoc_residents
  )

## Merge the lowest quartile tracts with the shapefile
lowest_quartile_tracts_geo <- wake_tracts %>%
  inner_join(lowest_quartile_tracts, by = c("GEOID" = "fips_code"))
```

# Visualizing the Most and Least Socially Vulnerable Communities in Wake County

The **most socially vulnerable areas** are census tracts in the **top 25%** for rates of no high school diploma (age 25+), individuals below 150% FPL, overcrowded housing, households without a vehicle, and BIPOC residents. The **least socially vulnerable areas** are in the **bottom 25%** for these indicators.

## Key Insight

Wake County is divided into 8 service zones. This map shows that **the most socially vulnerable communities are clustered together**, concentrated in the East Central service zone and nearby tracts on the borders of the North Central, South Central, and West Central service zones. On the other hand, **the least socially vulnerable communities are more distinctly spread across the county** in the Northern, North Central, West, and South Central service zones. We can use this information to help inform which tracts and service zones county-level investments should go to.

# Investigating Alignment Between Opportunity Zones and Socially Vulnerable Communities

Established by Congress in 2017 through the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, [Opportunity Zones](https://raleigh-wake.org/business-advantages/equitable-economic-development/opportunity-zones) are a nationwide incentive program to encourage long-term investment and economic growth in communities that have experienced historical disinvestment. The Opportunity Zones Program currently defines eligible census tracts as areas where the poverty rate is 20% or higher and/or family income is less than 80% of the area's median income. In Raleigh, there are [10 census tracts](https://ral.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=497bd2e832a1451f8ad2514bcba67ad8) designated as Opportunity Zones.

The shaded areas in this map are the **most socially vulnerable areas**, or census tracts in the **top 25%** for rates of no high school diploma (age 25+), individuals below 150% FPL, overcrowded housing, households without a vehicle, and BIPOC residents. Among these tracts, green areas are designated Opportunity Zones while gray areas are not.

## Key Insight

Of the 10 tracts identified as the most socially vulnerable areas, **4** are designated Opportunity Zones by the city of Raleigh. This overlap suggests the initiative is targeting areas with high social vulnerability, but could do better. **Expanding Opportunity Zone tract eligibility beyond poverty and income measures could lead to improved social vulnerability among communities that have been historically marginalized.** Policymakers should consider additional investment incentive programs for communities with lower rates of educational attainment and higher rates of severe housing problems, for example.
