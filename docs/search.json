    "text": "Key Insight #1\nIn the map below, yellow areas represent the most socially vulnerable communities, while blue areas represent the least socially vulnerable communities. Wake County is divided into 8 service zones. This map shows that the most socially vulnerable communities are clustered together, concentrated in the East Central service zone and nearby tracts on the borders of the North Central, South Central, and West Central service zones. On the other hand, the least socially vulnerable communities are more distinctly spread across the county in the Northern, North Central, West, and South Central service zones. We can use this information to help inform which neighborhoods county-level investments should go to.\n\n\nCode\n# Create layered map with service zones, tracts, and most/least socially vulnerable areas\n## Create base map\nbase_map &lt;- ggplot(data = wake_service_zones_sf) +\n  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry), fill = \"white\", color = \"gray\", size = 0.2) +\n  theme_map()\n\n## Add the most and least vulnerable tracts layer\nmap_top_tracts &lt;- base_map +\n  geom_sf(data = highest_quartile_tracts_geo, aes(fill = \"Most Vulnerable\"), color = \"gray\", alpha = .75) +\n  geom_sf(data = lowest_quartile_tracts_geo, aes(fill = \"Least Vulnerable\"), color = \"gray\", alpha = .75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Tract-Level Social Vulnerability\",\n    values = c(\"Least Vulnerable\" = \"#2c7fb8\", \"Most Vulnerable\" = \"#edf8b1\"),\n    labels = c(\"Least Vulnerable Areas\", \"Most Vulnerable Areas\")\n  )\n\n## Add the service zones layer\nzones &lt;- wake_service_zones_sf %&gt;%\n  group_by(zone_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(geometry = st_union(geometry))\n\nmap_with_zones &lt;- map_top_tracts +\n  geom_sf(data = zones, fill = NA, color = \"black\", size = 20)\n\n## Add the service zone label layer\nzone_centroids &lt;- zones %&gt;%\n  st_centroid()\n\nmap_with_labels &lt;- map_with_zones +\n  geom_sf_text(data = zone_centroids, aes(label = zone_name), size = 3, color = \"black\", fontface = \"bold\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Geographic Disparities in SVI Indicators in Wake County\",\n    caption = caption) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.direction = \"vertical\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, face = \"italic\", hjust=0, vjust=1))\n\nmap_with_labels"

This overlap suggests the initiative is targeting areas with high social vulnerability, but could do better. Expanding Opportunity Zone tract eligibility beyond poverty and income measures could lead to improved social vulnerability among even more marginalized communities. Policymakers should consider additional investment incentive programs for communities with lower rates of educational attainment and higher rates of severe housing problems, for example.\n\n\nCode\nhighest_quartile_tracts_geo_oz &lt;- highest_quartile_tracts_geo %&gt;%\n  mutate(oz = ifelse(\n    NAME %in% c(\n      '540.18','527.04','540.08','527.06','524.07','509', '545', '530.09', '528.03', '528.07'\n      ), \"1\", \"0\"))\n\n# Create layered map with service zones, tracts, and most/least socially vulnerable areas\n## Create base map\nbase_map &lt;- wake_service_zones_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(zone_name %in% c('East\\nCentral', 'North Central', 'West Central', 'South Central')) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry), fill = \"white\", color = \"gray\", size = 0.2) +\n  theme_map()\n\n## Add the most vulnerable tracts layer with Opportunity Zones highlighted\nmap_oz &lt;- base_map +\n  geom_sf(data = highest_quartile_tracts_geo_oz, aes(fill = oz), color = \"black\", alpha = .75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Opportunity Zone Status\",\n    values = c(\"1\" = \"#2ca25f\", \"0\" = \"gray\"),\n    labels = c(\"Not Opportunity Zone\", \"Opportunity Zone\")\n  )\n\n## Add the service zones layer\nzones &lt;- wake_service_zones_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(zone_name %in% c('East\\nCentral', 'North Central', 'West Central', 'South Central', 'East Central')) %&gt;%\n  group_by(zone_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(geometry = st_union(geometry))\n\nmap_with_zones &lt;- map_oz +\n  geom_sf(data = zones, fill = NA, color = \"black\", size = 20)\n\n## Add the service zone label layer\nzone_centroids &lt;- zones %&gt;%\n  st_centroid()\n\nmap_with_labels &lt;- map_with_zones +\n  geom_sf_text(data = zone_centroids, aes(label = zone_name), size = 3, color = \"black\", fontface = \"bold\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Opportunity Zone Status among Most Socially Vulnerable Areas in Wake County\",\n    caption = caption) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.direction = \"vertical\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, face = \"italic\", hjust=0, vjust=1))\n\nmap_with_labels"
